# Purpose

Wordsmith is a word game, where players guess a hidden word based on a similarity score (1 through n). 
Inspired by the game semantics, it uses cosine similarity between the guessed word and the target word, 
providing feedback to help players refine their guesses. The backend handles the serverside API, vector 
operations, game logic, and session management, while the frontend presents a simple interface for 
interaction. With a hint system and word vector math powering the gameplay, this project combines skills 
ive learned inside and out of the classroom to make a functional and fun game!
